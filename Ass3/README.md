## How To Use
Make sure you are in the correct directory, and run make in the command prompt. Once the makefile has finnished, run the program by typing:

> .\tweetManager

in the command line. <br>
You can then use:

>make clean

to clear out the .o files and the excecutable.

## Completed Components
All sections of the assignment where completed and implemented into the program. This includes
1. Create a new tweet
2. Display tweets
3. Search a tweet (by keyword)
4. Find how many words are "stop words"
5. Delete the nth tweet
6. Save tweets to a file 
7. Load tweets from a file

## Program Limitations
I was unable to determine how to remove the commas at the end of a tweets in the load tweets function. 

## Future Improvements
* Removing the commas at the end of a users tweet in load tweets
